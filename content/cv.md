# Curriculum Vitae 

## About Me

Miriah Peterson graduated from Brigham Young University in 2017 with a Bachelor’s degree in Physics. She attended The Univerity of Oklahoma pursuing a PhD in Quantum Optics, but dropped out after one semester to pursue her passion of earning a livable income and not incurring more student loans.

Currently a Senior Data Reliabilty Engineer at [Weave](https://grnh.se/ddbf9ca23us) in Lehi, Utah, Miriah focuses on research and development of scalable data pipelines, analytics pipelines, and Go microservices.

Sharing knowledge and experiences is a focus of Miriah's career. She has given many talks on Go programming, machine learning, and data engineering. Additionally, she works in the community as a board member for Forge Foundation Inc. and organizer of GoWest Conference, WomenWhoGo Utah meetup, and Machine Learning Utah meetup.
